                    <h3>Setting</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the design of this escape room, I aimed to convey the idea of "Living an experience" (Miguel
                        Ángel and Susana (Escape Barcelona), p.9). Therefore, in the escape room design, I have imposed
                        some limitations on myself since H.P. Lovecraft's stories are set in the 1920s. I intentionally
                        avoided adding any elements post-dating this period. Due to this decision, I refrained from
                        using common escape room elements such as numerical locks or electronic devices, as they would
                        disrupt the immersion I was seeking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Players will be divided into two groups: the intruders and the guards. The first group will
                        proceed to "question" the old man. The other two will wait outside, similar to the original
                        story, but with the difference that this time our participants will have the chance to survive
                        this adventure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The intruders will be locked in, and it will be explained to them that they have just awakened
                        and the last thing they remember is knocking on the old man's door. They recall nothing else
                        once the door opened. Therefore, they should hurry to escape before the old man arrives to enact
                        whatever sinister plan he may have in mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The players waiting outside will be informed that their companions are taking too long. If they
                        want to check, they should do so discreetly, entering through the back of the property, going
                        through a broken window. As they pass through the hole, the game master will make a stone move
                        to cover the hole they just entered through.
                    </p>

                            hidden somewhere in his decaying abode.</span>

                            src="../assets/img/escaperoom/escapeRoomPlane.png" width="80%" />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In each room, there may be additional furniture and ambiance elements, but only essential ones
                        for the escape room are shown in this plan. I will now discuss each space individually.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Dungeon</h4>
                    <p>
                        The dungeon is a space reminiscent of a damp basement, where there's little light. The walls are
                        made of old wood with mold creeping out from the corners. The floor is earthen, and in the
                        center of the room, there's a kind of luminous fungus providing a faint glow, except for a small
                        hole in the roof letting in the pale moonlight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To the left, there's a small, moldy mirror hanging on the wall next to an old, dirty bed. On the
                        right side of the bed, there's a small shelf with books. Just beside it, there's a small hole,
                        roughly eye-sized, with the word "rudder" written above it. On the opposite side of the mirror,
                        there's an illegible text "vi" (inverted horizontally so it must be viewed in the mirror)
                        written on the wall. Adjacent to it is a hole, about 10x7cm, leading to another room. Finally,
                        at the back, there's a barred door with a large padlock on the outside, securely closed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This room is an old office with dilapidated wooden panels, peeling wallpaper, and crumbling
                        ceiling plaster. Filled with stones with various ancient idol shapes, as mentioned in the story
                        (see Illustration 2), the three significant ones are marked on the plan:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the center of the room on the left, there's a desk with a newspaper clipping:

                    <p>
                        On the table, hung on the wall, there will be a world map from that era with continental
                        reliefs, a metallic ship, and a frame protruding above the relief, making the map and the ship
                        untouchable (referencing the fact that we are in a port city and the old man was a ship
                        captain).

                    <p>
                        This corridor serves as a transition between the first and second halves of the escape room and
                        is where the players gather. It's a dark and dusty hallway, similar to the office of the stones,
                        with creaky wooden panels, torn wallpaper, and crumbling ceiling plaster. It has old wooden
                        floors that creak as players walk, breaking the silence. There are three doors:

                        This room resembles what we would know as a dining room, spacious, with exposed beams
                        illuminated only by small skylights at its ends with small cobwebs. Upon entering, a stool is
                        seen in front of a small desk with a bottle with a lead pendulum hanging, along with gold coins
                        and a plant. The old man's gnarled cane leans against the desk. Next to it is a small window
                        resembling a U.S. basement, tall and narrow, with broken glass. In the center of the room is a
                        shelf with a collection of bottles in various shapes, all with a hanging pendulum and labels
                        like "Scarface", "Spanish Joe"...

                        against the wall, allowing visibility from behind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this room, players can obtain the tablet:
                    </p>
                    <div class="imageContainer">
                        <img class="img-fluid" alt="tablet" src="../assets/img/escaperoom/tablet.png" width="50%" />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        And the translation clue, a note stating:
                    </p>
                    <div class="imageContainer">
                        <img class="img-fluid" alt="note" src="../assets/img/escaperoom/note.png" width="35%" />

                    <p>
                        To decipher the messages in this room and the previous ones, to answer the question above the
                        exit and escape.

                    <h3>Puzzles and Player Progression</h3>
                    <p>
                        Players discover they are in adjacent rooms and start communicating. The office players read the
                        clue, and the dungeon players see a hole labeled "rudder," where they can observe a specific
                        stone with an open mouth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this information, the office players must obtain a magnet inside a face-shaped stone,
                        inserting their hand into the statue's mouth. Meanwhile, in the dungeon, there's a small shelf
                        with old books containing a map of the Atlantic Ocean with a set route and an X, marking the
                        destination of the expedition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this point, players in the room will know that the map is a puzzle. But since the map is
                        framed with the ship, they cannot move it. So, they must exchange the map and the magnet through
                        the hole. The office players guide the dungeon players on how to move the ship without seeing
                        the map until they reach the X. Once the point is reached, pressing a button on the ship will
                        open the statue's mouth next door to the door, and they must pass the key to the dungeon
                        players, who will manage to unlock their door.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the hallway, dungeon players must remove the barricade from the office and see the door at
                        the end. Through it, they will witness an actor portraying the terrible old man talking to a
                        bottle, explaining that there are new members for the group, but he must go fetch his tools. The
                        old man will exit through the door, and the door to the bottle room will unlock.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this room, the first thing players will see is the desk where the terrible old man was, which
                        has all the elements necessary to overcome the challenges in the room. The bottles will make the
                        sound of "cling," similar to the audiobook (<i>The Terrible Old Man - Illustrated Horror Story by
                        H.P. Lovecraft</i> - Lynx's Tales) from lower to higher frequency to warn them of the remaining time
                        before the terrible old man returns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the group starts investigating the room, they will find the dresser. In the first drawer,
                        there will be a pencil. The second will be empty, and the third, being larger than the others,
                        will be stuck and cannot be opened. However, it will have a hole in the upper right corner where
                        they can insert the old man's cane to pull the back and find the scale. Using the coins to
                        balance the scale will open a compartment containing a note that reads: "False bottom."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a simple puzzle, as it is a clue puzzle and does not penalize players who find the
                        bottom without the need for the clue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the second drawer, there will be a false bottom accessible by inserting the pencil through a
                        hole in the bottom, lifting the bottom, and the players will find the tablet and the translation
                        clue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the tablet and the clue on how to use it, players will translate the message above the
                        final door, resolving the final question: "Who am I?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To solve it, players must return to the previous rooms, where they must unlock the final word by
                        syllables. In the office, being longer, there won't be puzzles, and they should translate it as
                        is. But in the dungeon, they must look through the mirror, as the letters will be horizontally
                        inverted. Then, in the note, they will have the password.
                    </p>
                    <p>They should approach the door and say the password: "Providence" (referring to Lovecraft's
                        tombstone). Then, the game master will open the door, and they can safely escape. Otherwise, the
                        terrible old man will appear, and they will perish as in the story.</p>
