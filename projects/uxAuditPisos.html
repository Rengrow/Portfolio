                    <h4>Heuristic Analysis</h4>
                    <p>
                        I did a first analysis of the website based on the 10 principles of Nielsen. Where I sorted the
                        problems that I found in order of severity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will mention an example:
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h5>The website lacks a top search bar.</h5>
                    <p>The search bar, which should appear on all sections of the website, only shows up when viewing
                        property listings.</p>
                    <h6>Where the issue occurs:</h6>
                    <p>It happens on various pages of the website: Home page, selection of the housing search area, and
                        map-based search.</p>
                    <h6>Heuristic principle violated:</h6>
                    <p>This error breaches the principle of consistency and standards.</p>
                    <h6>Explanation:</h6>
                    <p>
                        Not only does it break a web design convention by not placing the search bar in the header,
                        which could be justified on the Home page as a central element, but it is also absent on other
                        pages like the mentioned selection of the housing search area. Additionally, the absence of the
                        search bar is not consistent throughout the website, as it appears when viewing property
                        listings. This lack of consistency is not in line with the website's own design.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Screenshot of the problem:</h6>

                    <h6>Solution or improvement:</h6>
                    <p>
                        The search bar should be included on all screens, except for the Home page, where it can be
                        presented as a central elemen
                    </p>
                    <h6>Example of a solution:</h6>

                    <h4>Socio-demographic Profiling</h4>
                    <p>
                        To better understand the target audience of "pisos.com," a socio-demographic profiling exercise
                        was conducted.
                    </p>
                    <a href="" target="_blank"></a>
                    <p>
                        According to <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/es/website/pisos.com/#demographics"
                            target="_blank">SimilarWeb</a>, the gender distribution of visitors to pisos.com is 53.23%
                        male and 46.77% female. The age distribution reveals that the two most prominent visitor groups
                        are aged 25-34 and 35-44, accounting for 19.78% and 20.68%, respectively.
                    </p>
                    <div class="imageContainer">
                        <img class="img-fluid" alt="demographics1" src="../assets/img/uxAuditPisos/demographics1.png"

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        When we correlate this data with the <a
                            href="https://www.pisos.com/aldia/informes/compartidos/septiembre-2023/1660733/"
                            target="_blank">shared housing study</a> on pisos.com, we can narrow down the
                        profile of individuals seeking rental or shared accommodation. Approximately 51.05% of those
                        seeking shared housing fall within the 18-25 age group, except in the Balearic Islands, where
                        the majority fall within the 26-35 age range.
                    </p>
                    <div class="imageContainer">
                        <img class="img-fluid" alt="demographics2" src="../assets/img/uxAuditPisos/demographics2.png"

                    <p>
                        Consequently, most individuals aged 18-25 may not have the financial capacity for renting.
                        According to the <a

                        This provides us with the average profile of someone seeking to buy or rent a property. However,
                        there is a third user profile that we haven't addressed until now, as mentioned by Miguel Ángel
                        Alemany, pisos.com's general director:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Our goal is to build loyalty beyond the property search, creating an online real estate
                        community where professionals and potential buyers can share opinions, generate information,
                        create their own blogs, and share common interests.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        This profile corresponds to real estate agents using the platform for their clients. Based on
                        the gathered information, we can assume that this person is well-established, likely a property
                        owner, and falls within an age range consistent with the studies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Considering the above, we can confidently identify three distinct user profiles:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The user seeking a rental is likely a woman aged 18 to 25.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The user seeking to buy a property is probably a man around 41 years old, likely with a
                            partner and children.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The professional user, utilizing the application for client property searches, is likely a
                            woman over 41 with experience in these types of websites and applications.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Given these three user groups, testing with three individuals from each group seems ideal. While
                        usability tests commonly involve five participants, conducting tests with three individuals from
                        each group should be sufficient and cost-effective, considering the similarities in the tests,
                        which may lead to overlapping issues and insights from the website.
                    </p>
                    <h4>User Testing</h4>
                    <h5>Test Design</h5>
                    <p>
                        Three distinct user tests were designed to evaluate different aspects of the website's
                        usability. These tests aimed to assess the effectiveness of key features, navigation pathways,
                        and the overall satisfaction of users interacting with the platform. Test scenarios were
                        carefully crafted to simulate real-world user interactions.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Rental Scenario</h6>
                    <p>
                        You have started discussing with your partner that it would be a good time to live together and
                        test your life as a couple. Therefore, you decide it would be a good idea to look for a rental
                        property in Terrassa.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tasks:</p>

                        <li>
                            Could you access the website www.pisos.com and try to find a rental property in the Terrassa
                            area?
                            <div class="bullet-points pl-3">

                                    or the area-based search, and see if the website's design contributes to user
                                    comfort or distraction.

                            After browsing through properties, you remember that parking in Terrassa is challenging. Can
                            you search for a rental property with a garage?

                            You've found a couple of interesting options, but the rent is quite high. Can you set up an

                    <p>
                        After living with your partner for a while and realizing that cohabitation is going well, you
                        decide it's time to buy a new house. Since you are not in a hurry and have experienced
                        renovations when living with your parents, you think a new construction apartment would be best.
                        Additionally, you have fallen in love with the neighborhood and made new friends, so you
                        wouldn't want to move far from this area.

                        invaluable in understanding user perspectives.
